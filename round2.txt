"800": ["This phase of pentesting takes place after privilege escalation\n and entails exfiltrating sensitive data and/or installing \npersistence to try and pivot to other hosts on a network",

	"Because of how popular mobile devices became in the early 2000s,\nit forced many companies hands into creating\nthis type of policy used for personal devices",
	"This type of compression places a stub just after the header of an executable\nsuch that the programs contents are only visible at runtime,\ntypically used to subvert static analysis techniques",
